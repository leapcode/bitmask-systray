Install it
----------

Install dependencies:

TODO: add qt5 deps here

```
  # make depends
```

Build the systray:
```
  $ git clone 0xacab.org/leap/bitmask-vpn && cd bitmask-vpn
  $ make build
```

You need at least go 1.11. If you have something older and are using ubuntu, you can do:

```
  make install_go
```

For other situations, have a look at https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Ubuntu or https://golang.org/dl/


OSX
----------
Using homebrew:

```
  $ git clone 0xacab.org/leap/bitmask-vpn && cd bitmask-vpn
  $ make depends
  $ make build

```

Linux
----------
Building the systray in linux will produce some `-Wdeprecated-declarations` warnings, like that:
```
cgo-gcc-prolog: In function ‘_cgo_3f9f61f961c9_Cfunc_gtk_font_button_get_font_name’:
cgo-gcc-prolog:5455:2: warning: ‘gtk_font_button_get_font_name’ is deprecated [-Wdeprecated-declarations]
In file included from /usr/include/gtk-3.0/gtk/gtk.h:106:0,
                 from ../../../go/src/github.com/gotk3/gotk3/gtk/gtk.go:48:
/usr/include/gtk-3.0/gtk/gtkfontbutton.h:96:23: note: declared here
 const gchar *         gtk_font_button_get_font_name  (GtkFontButton *font_button);
                       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```
They are expected and don't produce any problem on the systray.

Windows
---------
Download cygwin // https://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe
```
Install with the necessary packages:

mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core
mingw64-x86_64-gcc-g++ 

x86_64-w64-mingw32-c++
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc
make

Add to windowspath "C:\cygwin64\bin"
```
#### Windows Build

```
make build 
```
Build flags
```
ARCH : 386 or amd64 (default: amd64)
CCPath and CXXPath are either paths of compiler or filenames in %PATH% (defaults: x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc and x86_64-w64-mingw32-c++)
```
Examples:
```
make build ARCH=386
make build ARCH=386 CCPath=i686-w64-mingw32-gcc CXXPath=i686-w64-mingw32-c++
```
All options can be omitted! 

#### Windows Run

Rename bitmask-vpn to bitmask-vpn.exe to start with terminal output

or

run it with ```run bitmask-vpn``` without output

Run it
-------------
The default build is a standalone systray. It still requires a helper and openvpn installed to work. For linux the helper is
[bitmask-root](https://0xacab.org/leap/bitmask-dev/blob/master/src/leap/bitmask/vpn/helpers/linux/bitmask-root)
for windows and OSX there is [a helper written in go](https://0xacab.org/leap/bitmask-vpn/tree/master/pkg/helper/).

Run it:
```
  $ make build
  $ build/bin/bitmask-vpn

```

```
  make build
```


Running tests
-------------

```
  sudo apt install qml-module-qttest
  make test
  make test_ui
```


i18n
----

TODO: move this to developer docs

The translations are done in transifex. To help us contribute your translations there and/or review the existing
ones:
https://www.transifex.com/otf/bitmask/RiseupVPN/

When a string has being modified you need to regenerate the locales:
```
  $ make generate_locales
```


To fetch the translations from transifex and rebuild the catalog.go (API\_TOKEN is the transifex API token):
```
  $ API_TOKEN='xxxxxxxxxxx' make locales
```
There is some bug on gotext and the catalog.go generated doesn't have a package, you will need to edit
cmd/bitmask-vpn/catalog.go and to have a `package main` at the beginning of the file.

If you want to add a new language create the folder `locales/$lang` before running `make locales`.


Report an issue
-------------------

When you report an issue include the following information:

* what you expected to see
* what you got
* the version of the program. You can check the version on the about page.
* the logs of the program. The location of the logs depends on the OS:
  * linux: `/home/<your user>/.config/leap/systray.log`
  * OSX: `/Users/<your user>/Library/Preferences/leap/systray.log`, `/Applications/RiseupVPN.app/Contents/helper/helper.log` & `/Applications/RiseupVPN.app/Contents/helper/openvpn.log`
  * windows: `C:\Users\<your user>\AppData\Local\leap\systray.log`, `C:\Program Files\RiseupVPN\helper.log` & `C:\Program Files\RiseupVPN\openvp.log`
